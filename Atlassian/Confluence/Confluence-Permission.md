# Confluence Permission

For one to have edit rights in any page in a Confluence space, one MUST have the space permissions to do it first. The page-level restrictions takes the universe of all those who have view or edit rights in space permissions and says, "on this page, only this person, persons and/or group(s) can use their view/edit permissions".
