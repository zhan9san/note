# Fluence Python

Every collection in Python is `iterable`, and iterators are used internally to support:

- for loops;
- collection types construction and extension;
- looping over text files line by line;
- list, dict and set comprehensions;
- tuple unpacking;
- unpacking actual parameters with * in function calls.
