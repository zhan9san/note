```bash script
==> Installing heroku/brew/heroku
==> Caveats
To use the Heroku CLI's autocomplete --
  Via homebrew's shell completion:
    1) Follow homebrew's install instructions https://docs.brew.sh/Shell-Completion
        NOTE: For zsh, as the instructions mention, be sure compinit is autoloaded
              and called, either explicitly or via a framework like oh-my-zsh.
    2) Then run
      $ heroku autocomplete --refresh-cache
  OR
  Use our standalone setup:
    1) Run and follow the install steps:
      $ heroku autocomplete

zsh completions have been installed to:
  /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions

==> Caveats
==> heroku-node
heroku-node is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because heroku-node is only used by Heroku CLI (heroku/brew/heroku), which explicitly requires from Cellar.

If you need to have heroku-node first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/heroku-node/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
